## General info
This project is the first of many similar ones, all of which are turn-based multiplayer board games, so think of it as a first step to reaching a final goal.

The simplicity of this game makes it the best way to tease your skills, my ultimate goal was to be able to tackle any game of this kind, and I'm quite confident that I reached that point.
